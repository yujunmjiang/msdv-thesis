## Part 1: Production

During the pandemic, people have to follow the temporary rule to work from home. It brings a negative effect on the production, especially on the supply for the hardware production. Even though the pandemic did not cause a significant change on the software production, but many game projects (e.g. [League of Legends: Wild Rift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZC_8818Ttg)) were postponed due to the delay of development, regional testing, and travel.
