## Part 1: Production

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have to follow the temporary rule to work from home. It brings a negative effect on the production, especially on the supply for the hardware production. Even though the pandemic did not cause a significant change on the software production, but many game projects (e.g. [League of Legends: Wild Rift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZC_8818Ttg)) were postponed due to the delay of development, regional testing, and travel. The interesting thing is some underrated games became the most popular products when people were quarantined at home. For example, the social simulation video game Animal Crossing won [the best family game](https://thegameawards.com/nominees/best-family) at The Game Awards, which shows how people reunite in the digital world in a special time.

In this part, the audience will learn both positive and negative effects on the production process. Also, the new popular game categories during the pandemic are discovered.
